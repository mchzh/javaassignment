Assignment 4 review feedback:

Your code is good, few comments as follows:
1. Make your assignment clean. If you do not need something inside, remove it, please not comment inside.
2. Do not catch Exception super class and print out array out of boundary, not all exceptions all array out of boundary.
3. Do not put non-English characters in your code.
Good job, keep going.

	Computer will ask the person playing the game to guess the number. Computer will respond if the guessed number is greater or less than or equal to what computer has guessed..
	
	For eg:- Let's say Computer has guessed 67 (Person playing the Game will not know this)
	>>Please guess a number between 1 and 100 - You have 5 chances to guess
	>>32
	>>32 is less than what I've guessed - You have 4 chances to guess
	>>75
	>>75 is greater than what I've guessed - You have 3 chances to guess
	>>50
	>>50 is less than what I've guessed - You have 2 chances to guess
	>>67
	>>Congratulations! You've guessed it right and you guessed it in 3 chances..
	
	HINT : Use the following code to generate a Random number between 1 and 100
